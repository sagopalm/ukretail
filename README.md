# ukretail
My very first Kaggle data science project on UK Retail E-Commerce data set

This project includes two parts:

1. Data analysis and preprocess (UK_Retail_DataAnalysis.ipynb)
2. Time series modeling using ARIMA model (UK_Retail_TimeSeries.ipynb)

They can be run independently if you download all files from this branch.
